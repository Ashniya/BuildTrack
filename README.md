# BuildTrack
A web-based construction site progress tracker.
It allows site engineers and managers to upload daily updates in the form of text and images for each construction site. Each site has its own dedicated page where progress is recorded and previous updates can be viewed anytime.

BuildTrack includes a secure login system, a dashboard to select or add sites, and simple upload forms for daily tracking. The interface is clean and user-friendly, built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.

The main aim of BuildTrack is to make construction monitoring more organized, digital, and accessible for teams working on-site.
